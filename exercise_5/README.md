# Exercise 5: Strings, Collections and Iterators

## Tasks

### 1) Rustlings

Work yourself through the exercise sets 09, 11 and 18.
You can run Rustlings with Gitpod, or just install the whole package on your local system.

### 2) Generate Fibonacci using an Iterator

In previous exercise 3â€“3, we have updated our implementation for calculating Fibonacci sequences recursively. \
Use your knowledge of Iterators and write your own implementation instead of using functions. \
The file `src/main.rs` provides some scaffolding you can use.

See [Iterator documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.take) for insights on working
and using your Iterator implementation.

### 3) HashMap and more

In exercise 4, we learned about parsing JSON into custom types with `serde`.
Now, we introduce some updates and two JSON fields using the same `struct` representation (authors, director). \
With this task, we upgrade how the data is stored and organized (use the new `library.json` provided).

#### A) Write a converter

Develop some functions or methods that convert the old JSON format into the new one below (still using
the `vec` collection). \
 to represent proper IDs we use the crate [Uuid](https://docs.rs/uuid/latest/uuid/index.html) (configure
with `v4` for generating IDs).

Store the new library format under `library_new.json` in your project root directory.

**Checklist**

- We need custom types for the _old_ JSON format
- We need custom types for the _new_ JSON format
- Read/Write functionality for both files (`serde`)
- Crate `uuid` should be added

**Hint**: To check for the enum variant and process the fields for the new library version, `match` should be used. \
This is called `Destructuring` (see exercise 6).
```rust
match item_variant {
    ItemOld::Book(BookOld{ title, year, isbn, authors }) => {
        // qImplement your logic
    }
    ItemOld::Movie(MovieOld{ title, year, director }) => {
        // Implement your logic
    }
    ItemOld::Newspaper(NewspaperOld{ title, date }) => {
        // Implement your logic
    }
}
```

> Note: JSON for items below is incomplete, the representation of the new format only shows the relation on
> author/director to person list

```json
{
  "persons": {
    "Uuid": {
      "name": "NAME",
      "birthYear": 1970
    },
    "Uuid": {
      "name": "NAME",
      "birthYear": 1970
    }
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "book",
      "authors": [
        "Uuid",
        "Uuid"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "movie",
      "director": [
        "Uuid"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### B) Introduce HashMaps

Rewrite your implementation so that all persons are parsed into a `HashMap<Uuid, Person>`.
Items can still be stored in a `Vec<Item>`.

Make sure to connect each item having authors/director with the corresponding items from the new `HashMap`. \

#### C) Handling duplicate data

We still can have duplicate items since vectors do not care about uniqueness of their data.
Try to solve this problem using two different approaches.

- Implement routines checking our `item` before pushing it to the vector
    - Might be necessary to add new trait(s) to `derive`: [Eq](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html)
- Another approach: Read about `HashSet` and try to implement a solution using the hashing functionality
    - Again, new traits must be added: [Hash](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashSet.html)
